# BlockchainFoodTraceabilityCMS

​    As consumer demand continues to change and consumers are more and more concerned about food safety, people want to be involved in food supply chain management so that every link in the supply chain can be presented to consumers. This project aims to create a complete blockchain-based food supply chain management system, including two parts: front-end and back-end. The front-end sets up supply chain participants and the back-end sets up administrators who respond to the front-end participants. The blockchain browser and other front-end frameworks are used in the front-end to call blockchain data through the interface and present it to the users.
