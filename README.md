# BlockchainFoodTraceabilityCMS

  As consumer demand continues to change and consumers are more and more concerned about food safety, people want to be involved in food supply chain management so that every link in the supply chain can be presented to consumers. This project aims to create a complete blockchain-based food supply chain management system, including two parts: front-end and back-end. The front-end sets up supply chain participants and the back-end sets up administrators who respond to the front-end participants. The blockchain browser and other front-end frameworks are used in the front-end to call blockchain data through the interface and present it to the users.
  Traditional farming process can not be strictly open and transparent, such as a variety of hormone and drug abuse, as well as some poor-quality feed for the second best. The preservation of these data under traditional supply chain conditions basically relies on paper records, which are somewhat arbitrary, and consumers cannot identify the authenticity of these data. In addition, the traditional supply chain management is a centralized management model, with poor information flow between most links, thus affecting the efficiency of the whole supply chain management. Therefore, for supply chain management, it is facing the dual challenges of efficiency and security and transparency, and there is an urgent need for effective changes to promote more efficient, transparent and secure food supply chain management. From the technical point of view, blockchain technology has the advantages of decentralization, openness and transparency, and non-tampering, which can solve the shortcomings of the current food supply chain management. Combining blockchain technology with the current food supply chain management can not only effectively improve the transparency of the whole supply chain, but also enhance the efficiency of the supply chain management.
